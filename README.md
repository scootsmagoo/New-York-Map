# Gotham — A Timeline of New York City

An interactive, pannable timeline of New York City's history, from
Lenapehoking to Greater New York (1919). Pan through time and watch the
city's built-up footprint spread across the five boroughs; click into any era
for its people, places, and events, with live summaries and images from
Wikipedia.

Inspired by *Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898* by Edwin G. Burrows
and Mike Wallace, and its sequel *Greater Gotham* by Mike Wallace.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # open http://localhost:5173
```

## How to use

- **Drag / scroll / pinch the timeline** at the bottom; the year under the
  center line drives the map.
- **Click an era band** to zoom to that era; press **▶** (or space) to play
  through time.
- **Explore this era** lists the era's people, places, and events; click
  anything — timeline marks, map markers, panel rows — for the full story.
- Arrow keys pan time; `+` / `-` zoom; the map pans and zooms independently.

## Deploying

Pushes to `main` build and publish automatically via GitHub Actions. One-time
setup: in the repo's **Settings → Pages**, set *Source* to **GitHub Actions**.
The site will be served at `https://scootsmagoo.github.io/New-York-Map/`.
